A Better Bill Splitter (Better BS) to fairly split the bill based on prorated amounts so that no one has to be unhappy when they order a $5 beer during happy hour and have to cought up $10 extra to split the tax and tip evenly!!! >=[

Desktop app for now that i'm looking to make web based

Python, Tkinter

I want everyone to use BBS as an easy, simple way to split bills! I originally used an excel sheet with formulas and I'm slowly integrating those complexities into the app as I learn how to.

check screenshot in the repo to see it in action!
